Ensure Git is installed on your system. You can download it from git-scm.com and follow the installation instructions.
2. Configure Git:
Set up Git with your name and email address using the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
arduino
Copy code
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
3. Install VS Code:
Download and install Visual Studio Code from code.visualstudio.com.
4. Open Your Project:
Launch VS Code and open your project folder (File > Open Folder...).
Initializing a Git Repository:
1. Initialize Repository:
Open the integrated terminal in VS Code (Ctrl+ or Cmd+) and navigate to your project directory if not already there.
Initialize a new Git repository by running the following command:
csharp
Copy code
git init
Making Commits:
1. Stage Files:
In VS Code, navigate to the Source Control view by clicking on the Git icon in the Activity Bar (or Ctrl+Shift+G).
You'll see a list of changed files. Click the + icon next to each file you want to stage for commit, or click + next to "Changes" to stage all changes.
2. Commit Changes:
Enter a commit message in the textbox at the top of the Source Control view.
Press Ctrl+Enter or click the checkmark icon to commit the changes.
Pushing Changes to GitHub:
1. Create a GitHub Repository (if not already done):
Go to github.com and create a new repository. Note down the repository URL (e.g., https://github.com/username/repository.git).
2. Add Remote Repository:
In the integrated terminal (or command prompt), add your GitHub repository as the remote origin:
csharp
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/username/repository.git
Replace the URL with your GitHub repository URL.
3. Push Commits:
Push your committed changes to GitHub:
css
Copy code
git push -u origin main
Here, main is the name of your main branch. If your default branch is named differently (e.g., master), replace main with your branch name.
Additional Tips:
Branching and Merging: Use VS Code's Git integration to create branches, merge changes, and manage branches effectively.
Viewing History: Use the Source Control view in VS Code to view commit history, compare changes, and revert changes if needed.
Pulling Changes: Use git pull to fetch and integrate changes from the remote repository into your local repository.
